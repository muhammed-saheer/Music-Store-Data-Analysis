#SQL Portfolio Project: Music Store Data Analysis

Welcome to my SQL Portfolio Project! This project demonstrates my ability to analyze data using SQL queries on a **Music Store Database**. The dataset includes information about artists, albums, tracks, invoices, customers, and genres. Through this project, I have solved various business problems by writing complex SQL queries to extract meaningful insights.

##🎯 Project Overview

This project involves analyzing a **Music Store Database** to answer key business questions. The dataset includes tables such as 'customer', 'invoice', 'invoice_line', 'track', 'album', 'artist', and 'genre'. Below are some of the questions I addressed:


**Senior Most Employee**: Who is the senior-most employee based on job title?

**Country with Most Invoices**: Which country has the most invoices?

**Top 3 Invoice Totals**: What are the top 3 values of total invoices?

**Best City for Promotions**: Which city has the highest sum of invoice totals?

**Best Customer**: Who is the customer that spent the most money?

**Rock Music Listeners**: Return the email, first name, last name, and genre of all Rock music listeners.

**Top Rock Artists**: Which artists have written the most Rock music?

**Longest Tracks**: Return all track names with a song length longer than the average song length.

**Customer Spending on Artists**: How much amount did each customer spend on artists?

**Most Popular Genre by Country**: What is the most popular music genre for each country?
